## Completly Discord complaiant functional now!

This is a simple tool which downloads pictures (and instagram videos) posted in discord channels of your choice to a local folder. It handles various sources like twitter differently to make sure to download the best quality available.

It also as well looks up using the SauceNao API for the title, artist and source of the document. And now properly handles and behaves like a bot as instead of a self-serve bot. Forked for mostly usability and currently updating and uploading images to a dedicated booru page hosted by yours truly.
